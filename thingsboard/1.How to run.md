# How to run in local

## **Environment Dependence**

> 1. Java environment, JDK11(official recommended).
> 2. Maven environment.
> 3. Nodejs environment, and install Yum environment.
> 4. Plugins like `Lombok` and `Protobuf` and so on.

## Step 1

Get the resource code from [github.com/thingsboard](https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard)

## Step 2

Open the repository by IntelliJ IDEA, and run mvn clean install.

## **Question**

### 1. yarn install some dependencies will fail, like packages `CurvedLines` and `flot`, how to solve this?

> you need to open the file `package.json` which in root folder `thingsboard`, and find keywords like `CurvedLines`, `Flot`, you will find them :
>  ```json
>  "flot": "https://github.com/thingsboard/flot.git#0.9-work",
>  "flot.curvedlines": "https://github.com/MichaelZinsmaier/CurvedLines.git#master"
>  ```

Then remove the prefix `https://` and reinstall the dependencies by yarn install.

### 2. when installing the console has the error message `class lombok.javac.apt.LombokProcessor (in unnamed module @0x60844992) cannot access class com.sun.tools.javac.processing.JavacProcessingEnvironment`

> Your jdk version is to high, and you must use `JDK11`

### 3. The console has the error message `Unsupported or unrecognized SSL message`
